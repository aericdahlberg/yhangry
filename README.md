This is a independent contract project demo with a startup to aquire chef leads. The purpose of this project was to collect data on chef leads and demostrate the capacity for a scalable system. 

To create a scalable system to acquire chef leads, I'm targeting culinary school alumni, gig platforms and community chef groups. These options allow us to post an opportunity and the chefs looking for work will apply directly to yhangry. This requires no effort on our part besides creating a job post. 

To harvest data as quickly as possible I would use web scraping on alumni groups of culinary schools or facebook groups. This is free and can generate a lot of leads. In this proposed method I will get sample data from the culinary institute of america, but by joining the alumni network for this institution and access to facebook groups, the potential for leads increases by the tens of thousands.

Data sources
Pros
Cons
Instagram and tikTok Chef Influencers
Direct connection to chefs
Network opportunities or follow up leads
Potential partnership opportunities 
Chefs may not be looking for work
LinkedIn
Direct connection to leads 
Expensive when used for scale
Chefs many not be on LinkedIn 
Gig Platforms (like Upwork or good food jobs)
Chefs actively seeking work	
Competition and high fees
Culinary school alumni
Chefs looking for work
Chefs may inexperienced 
Need institutional approval to access database
Meetup/Facebook Groups
Hundreds of thousands of members between multiple groups
Not all of the members will be qualified
Members may have information out of date



Activation
Stage 2: Implement
Build an executable prototype
Deliverables:
A GitHub link to your implementation
A CSV/Google Sheet with chef data gathered via your method (sample data of 100 chef leads is sufficient)
Stage 3: Reflect
What worked well?
I created some leads from alumni of the Culinary Institute of America. While the information I obtained is useful, the work done is more of an example of how I could get information from a webpage, an online group or a database. This method used web scraping, but depending on where/how the data is stored there are other methods for retrieval. 
What were the biggest challenges?
The biggest challenge was finding the source of information. As I mentioned in stage 1, the most scalable architecture will be to build a database of our own using alumni groups and databases, facebook groups and other online information. For this specific example, the challenge was formatting the html properly, but that was handled using the inspect button and some conditional statements in code. 
How would you iterate and improve if you had more time/resources?
I would increase the number of websites and other areas I am pulling information from and update and improve the web scraping code to do so. I would iterate and improve on the code to make sure I am getting the correct information based on the content and layout of each source.  This would allow this process to be scalable.
