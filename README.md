At Yhangry, we are expanding into new markets and need to rapidly identify and acquire 500K+ chef leads in the US. Your task is to design, execute, and reflect on a scalable approach to solving this problem.

Stage 1: Plan
Outline your approach
Identify data sources and evaluate pros and cons of each
Propose a method to harvest data quickly
Public alumni db local
Not sure how many chefs ar eon linked in
I would use a combination of web scraping, APIs, social media outreach and partnerships to identify chef leads. 
I would target leads on freelance platforms like Upwork and Fiverr, culinary schools, social media groups, and gig economy networks. 
There is a lot of information about chefs spanning different websites and groups. LinkedIn, job recruitment sites like Upwork, Private chef/catering companies, Chef Groups on Facebook and Meetup like the private chef network, Culinary school alumni, restaurant staff, chef networking groups, chef influencers. While all of these would provide great information, most would take a lot of work to fully access and explore.

Build an executable prototype
Deliverables:
A GitHub link to your implementation
A CSV/Google Sheet with chef data gathered via your method (sample data of 100 chef leads is sufficient)
